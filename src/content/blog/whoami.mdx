**Hi I am Jenson Reggentin**

I am a Business Informatics Student living in Stralsund. Right now I work at Bosch in the factory in Ansbach. There I develop Software to monitor production lines.

## What am I Interested in?

My main interests are backend development, data engineering, and DevOps. Also, from time to time, I like to explore new technologies and take part in CTFs at Hack The Box.
Currently, I am learning about Docker, Golang and Log-Monitoring.
For work at the moment my main task is implementing a logging solution for the Node.js backend processes.

I also really wanna work with Kubernetes and Terraform in the future.

### Current Projects

At the Moment my main hobby project is a task manager to organize montage teams. The project is written in Golang and uses a Postgres Database. The Frontend is written in React-Native.
I will probably write a blog post about this project in the future.
