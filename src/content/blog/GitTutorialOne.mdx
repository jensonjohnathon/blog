**Short Tutorial on how to use cherry-pick**

Picture this, youre colleugue pushes 5 commits 2 are ok, 2 good and one is complete garbage.
Now how do you take the garbage out?

**Cherry-Pick**

## Let's start with a simple txt file in an empty git directory.

Now let's add our txt file

```bash
cat text.txt
Imagine a Function here
```

now we add it to git

```bash
git init
hint: Using 'master' as the name for the initial branch. This default branch name
hint: is subject to change. To configure the initial branch name to use in all
hint: of your new repositories, which will suppress this warning, call:
hint:
hint:   git config --global init.defaultBranch <name>
hint:
hint: Names commonly chosen instead of 'master' are 'main', 'trunk' and
hint: 'development'. The just-created branch can be renamed via this command:
hint:
hint:   git branch -m <name>
Initialized empty Git repository in /home/kali/Desktop/gittest/.git/


git add text.txt


git commit
[master (root-commit) 27c1aae] Initial commit
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 text.txt



git log --oneline


27c1aae (HEAD -> master) Initial commit
```

Perfect now we have our file lets add 5 commits.

```bash
git log --oneline

d95c7b9 (HEAD -> master) 6th Function added
bdb650c Function 5 added
4dcaa6d 4th Function added (bad one)
5d780f9 Added 3rd Function + typo fix in 2nd Function
41b540d 2nd Function
27c1aae Initial commit
```

Done!

**Now how do we get rid of the bad commit?**

First we make a new branch that starts before the bad commit.

```bash
└─$ git branch fix 5d780f9
```

so in the master branch we have

```bash
└─$ cat text.txt
Imagine a Function here

FunctionTwo looking good

FunctionThree looking ok

FunctionFour looking real bad

FunctionFive looking good

FunctionSix looking ok
```

and in the fix branch we have

```bash
└─$ git checkout fix
Switched to branch 'fix'
```

```bash
└─$ cat text.txt
Imagine a Function here

FunctionTwo looking good

FunctionThree looking ok
```
